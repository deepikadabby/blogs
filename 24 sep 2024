Today, I found myself facing a frustrating setback while working on the Node.js portion of my live chat application.
I encountered an error with Nodemon, a tool used for automatically restarting the Node.js server when changes are made.
Unfortunately, personal matters were also weighing heavily on my mind, making it difficult to focus and troubleshoot the issue effectively.
Due to these distractions, I was unable to make significant progress today.
I'll take a break, clear my head, and return to the project with renewed energy and focus.
