Today, I found myself facing another frustrating issue with Nodemon.
Despite my previous attempts to resolve the problem, it seems to be persisting.
I've tried reinstalling Nodemon, checking for conflicts with other dependencies, and verifying my configuration settings, but nothing seems to be working.
This recurring issue is slowing down my development process and causing unnecessary frustration.
I'll continue to investigate the problem and seek help from the community if needed.
I'm determined to overcome this obstacle and ensure that Nodemon is functioning properly 
so I can continue making progress on my live chat application.
