Today was a productive day as I focused on the server-side implementation of my live chat application.
I made significant progress in establishing a robust and scalable server infrastructure using Node.js.
I implemented essential features like message handling, user authentication, and real-time updates. 
The server is now able to efficiently process incoming messages, broadcast them to connected clients, and maintain a persistent connection.
I'm pleased with the progress I've made and the solid foundation I've laid for the server-side components.
With continued development, I believe I can create a reliable and efficient server that supports the live chat application's functionality
