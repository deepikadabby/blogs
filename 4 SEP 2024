Today was a particularly challenging day in my JavaScript learning journey. 
I delved into the complexities of passing arguments, including value vs. reference, the call and apply methods, and the bind method.
Unfortunately, I found myself feeling overwhelmed and frustrated. 
The concepts seemed abstract and difficult to grasp, and I struggled to understand the practical implications.
To make matters worse, I've been struggling to manage my time effectively.
Between work, personal commitments, and my JavaScript studies, I feel constantly overwhelmed.
I've tried to create a structured schedule, but it's been difficult to stick to.
