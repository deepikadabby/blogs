Today was supposed to be a day of progress as I continued building Banklist.
I had planned to delve into DOM traversing and event propagation in practice, but due to a persistent power outage, my productivity was significantly hampered.
While I managed to squeeze in some work during brief periods of power, it was difficult to maintain focus and momentum.
The constant interruptions were frustrating, and I felt a sense of discouragement.
Despite the setbacks, I'm determined to persevere and make the most of the limited time I have available.
I'm eager to continue my work on Banklist as soon as the power is restored.
I believe that with patience and determination, I can overcome these challenges and achieve my goals.
