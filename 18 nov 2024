Today, I turned my attention to the core components of my live chat application: the chat header and input field.
While these elements may seem simple, designing a user-friendly and intuitive interface requires careful consideration.
I spent the day refining the layout and styling of the chat header, ensuring that it provides essential information like user names and connection status in a clear and concise manner. 
I also focused on creating a responsive input field that adapts to different screen sizes and provides a seamless typing experience.
Although these components may seem basic, they play a crucial role in creating a positive user experience. 
I'm excited to see how these elements will come together and contribute to the overall functionality of the live chat application.
