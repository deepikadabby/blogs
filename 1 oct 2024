Today was a particularly challenging day for me.
Personal issues were weighing heavily on my mind, making it difficult to focus on my live chat application development.
To make matters worse, I encountered another problem with Nodemon, a tool I've been struggling with for some time. 
This setback was frustrating and demoralizing, especially given the emotional turmoil I was experiencing.
Due to these distractions, I started my day late and ended up working well into the evening. 
While I managed to make some progress, it wasn't as productive as I had hoped
