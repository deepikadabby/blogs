Today, I encountered a frustrating bug that prevented my chat application from functioning as intended.
I spent a good portion of the day debugging and troubleshooting, but eventually, I managed to isolate the issue.
Once the bug was fixed, I made some progress in implementing AJAX to enable real-time messaging.
I'm excited to continue exploring AJAX and its potential in building a dynamic and interactive chat application.
