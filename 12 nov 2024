Today, I faced significant challenges while working on the contacts feature for my live chat application. 
The complexity of managing user relationships and handling real-time updates has proven to be more difficult than anticipated.
I've encountered various technical hurdles, including data synchronization issues and efficient storage of contact information.
These challenges have slowed down my progress and increased the overall development time.
I'm determined to overcome these obstacles and implement a robust and user-friendly contacts feature.
