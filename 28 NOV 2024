Today marks the third day of my relentless effort to complete the backend portion of my live chat application.
Unfortunately, the challenges continue to mount.
I've been grappling with numerous errors and unexpected behaviors, making it difficult to achieve the desired functionality.
The pressure to complete this project, coupled with the upcoming college viva and the need to prepare presentations and reports, has been overwhelming.
I'm feeling drained and demotivated, as the deadlines loom closer.
I'll take a short break to recharge and come back with a fresh perspective.
