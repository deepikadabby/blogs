Today, I made some headway in the Node.js portion of my live chat application. 
I implemented a new feature that allows users to send private messages to each other.
This required careful consideration of the backend logic and ensuring seamless integration with the frontend.
While there were a few challenges along the way, I was able to overcome them and successfully integrate the new functionality.
I'm excited to see how this feature enhances the user experience and adds a new dimension to the chat application.
