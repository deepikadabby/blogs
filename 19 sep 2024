Today marks the third day of my live chat application project, and I've made some progress in the JavaScript implementation.
However, I'm starting to feel a bit overwhelmed and unsure about the direction I'm taking.
While I've managed to create the basic structure for sending and receiving messages, I'm struggling with implementing real-time functionality.
I've tried a few different approaches, but nothing seems to be working as expected.
I'm determined to overcome this hurdle and continue making progress on my live chat application 
With a fresh perspective and a bit more effort, I believe I can successfully implement the real-time functionality and bring this project to completion.
