Today, I turned my attention to the contacts feature for my live chat application. 
This feature will allow users to add and manage their contacts, making it easier to initiate private conversations.
I'm confident in my approach to this feature.
I've broken down the task into smaller, manageable steps.
While there are still some technical challenges to overcome, I'm optimistic about the progress I've made so far.
