Today marks the beginning of an exciting new project: creating a web application called Banklist using JavaScript. 
Despite feeling a bit under the weather, I'm energized by the prospect of building something from scratch.
I've already started planning out the features and functionality of Banklist.
I envision a user-friendly interface that allows users to create accounts, make transactions, and view their account balance.
I'm excited to see how my JavaScript skills will come into play as I bring this project to life.
While I'm feeling a bit unwell,
I'm finding solace and enjoyment in my work. 
I'm building my skills and gaining a deeper understanding of web development.
