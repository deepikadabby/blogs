Today i don't have much to say .Today was supposed to be a day of progress .
I had planned to delve into implementing a sticky navigation, the scroll event, and revealing elements on scroll.
However, due to a persistent power outage, my productivity was significantly hampered.
The constant interruptions were incredibly frustrating, and I found it difficult to maintain focus and momentum.
The power outages seemed to be endless, and it felt like I was constantly being set back.
Despite the setbacks, I'm determined to persevere and make the most of the limited time I have available.
