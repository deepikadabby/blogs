Today, I shifted my focus to the backend development of my live chat application.
I encountered several roadblocks while working with Node.js and Socket.io. 
Debugging the errors and ensuring smooth communication between the client and server has been a challenging task.
The complexity of real-time communication and the need for efficient data handling have added to the difficulty.
I'm struggling to balance the backend development with the ongoing work on the frontend and the preparation of the training report and presentation.
Despite these challenges, I'm determined to persevere.
I'll break down the tasks into smaller, more manageable chunks and seek help from online resources .
With patience and persistence, I believe I can overcome these obstacles and create a robust and functional live chat application
