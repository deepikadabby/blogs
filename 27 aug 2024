Today, I delved into the dynamic world of the Document Object Model (DOM) and event handling in JavaScript.
I learned how to manipulate HTML elements, change styles, and respond to user interactions.
It's fascinating to see how these concepts can be combined to create interactive and responsive web interfaces. 
As I continue to explore the possibilities, I'm excited to apply my knowledge to build more complex and engaging web applications.
