Today, I delved into the world of sets and maps in JavaScript.
These data structures offer unique ways to store and manipulate collections of data.
Sets, unordered collections of unique values, are ideal for checking membership and removing duplicates.
Maps, on the other hand, store key-value pairs, providing a more flexible and efficient way to organize data.
I explored various operations on sets and maps, such as adding, removing, and checking for elements. 
I also learned about their performance characteristics and when to use each data structure appropriately. 
By understanding sets and maps, I can write more efficient and expressive JavaScript code.
