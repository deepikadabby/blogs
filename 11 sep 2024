Today was supposed to be another productive day in my JavaScript journey as I continued building Banklist.
I had planned to focus on selecting, creating, deleting elements, and working with styles, attributes, and classes.
However, due to a power outage, my progress was halted.
While the unexpected power cut was frustrating, I used the downtime to review the concepts I've learned so far and plan out the next steps for Banklist.
I'm determined to make the most of my limited time and continue my learning as soon as the power is restored.
Despite the setback, I remain optimistic about the project. 
I'm excited to see how my JavaScript skills will come into play as I bring Banklist to life.
