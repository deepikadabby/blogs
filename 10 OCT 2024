Today, I continued my journey into the world of Socket.io, a powerful tool for real-time communication in web applications. 
Unfortunately, my efforts have been met with some frustrating challenges.
I've encountered various errors and unexpected behaviors while working with Socket.io. 
Debugging these issues can be tricky, as they often involve complex interactions between the client and server sides.
I've spent a significant amount of time reviewing the documentation, searching for online resources, and experimenting with different approaches.
Despite my efforts, I'm still struggling to resolve some of the problems I'm facing.
