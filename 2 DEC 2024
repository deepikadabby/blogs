Today, I focused on implementing real-time functionality in the backend of my live chat application.
This involved leveraging the power of WebSockets to enable instant message delivery and updates.
I've been grappling with the intricacies of handling multiple connections, broadcasting messages, and ensuring efficient data transfer.
While the process has been challenging, I've made significant progress in establishing a robust and scalable backend infrastructure.
As I approach the completion of this feature, I'm eager to see how it will enhance the overall user experience.
With each successful step, I'm getting closer to creating a fully functional and engaging live chat application.
