Today, I found myself struggling with the MongoDB integration for  live chat application.
I'm unsure about the most efficient workflow and the best approach to handle data persistence and retrieval.
The complexity of the task is overwhelming, and I'm feeling a bit lost. I've spent hours trying to figure out the optimal solution, but I'm still facing challenges.
I'll take a step back, break down the problem into smaller, more manageable tasks, and consult online resources and tutorials.
With a clear plan and a focused approach, I hope to make significant progress in the coming days
