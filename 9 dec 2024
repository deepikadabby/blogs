Today was a whirlwind of activity, juggling the demands of my live chat application with the looming pressure of upcoming exams.
I spent a significant portion of the day focusing on the backend, particularly the real-time functionality. 
While I've made progress, there are still some challenges to overcome, such as optimizing message delivery and handling large numbers of concurrent users.
Balancing these technical hurdles with exam preparation has been tough. 
However, I'm determined to stay focused and make the most of my time.
With each passing day, I'm getting closer to completing this project and acing my exams.
