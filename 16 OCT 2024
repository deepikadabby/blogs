Today was a fruitful day as I focused on both the server-side implementation and some design enhancements for my live chat application.
I also addressed some minor performance optimizations to ensure the server runs efficiently.
In terms of design, I made some adjustments to the user interface to enhance its visual appeal and usability.
These changes included modifying the layout, colors, and typography.
Overall, I'm pleased with the progress I've made today.
