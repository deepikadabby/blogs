Today, I took a much-needed break from the complexities of database integration and focused on a more visually appealing aspect of my live chat application: user avatars or profile pictures.
After days of struggling with terminal errors in VS Code, I finally managed to resolve the issue.
This breakthrough has significantly boosted my confidence and allowed me to shift my attention to other important aspects of the project.
By implementing user avatars, I aim to create a more personalized and engaging chat experience. 
I'm excited to see how this feature enhances the overall user interface and user experience
