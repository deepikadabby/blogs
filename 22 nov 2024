Today marked the third consecutive day of grappling with the chat input field for my live chat application.
Despite my best efforts, I'm still encountering persistent errors and unexpected behaviors.
The complexity of handling real-time message updates, user input validation, and seamless integration with the server-side has proven to be quite challenging.
The pressure to complete this feature, along with the looming deadline for the training report and presentation, is adding to the stress.
but I believe I can overcome these obstacles and create a robust and user-friendly live chat application.
