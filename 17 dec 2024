Today, I continued my relentless pursuit of completing the backend for my live chat application.
With the deadline looming and my college viva date announced, the pressure is on!
I'm focusing on finalizing the real-time communication features, ensuring seamless message delivery and a smooth user experience.
While there are still some bugs to iron out and performance optimizations to implement, I'm making steady progress.
Parallel to the development work, I'm also diligently working on the project report and presentation.
The viva is fast approaching, and I want to be well-prepared to showcase my work and answer any questions.
