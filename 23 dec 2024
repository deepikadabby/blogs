Today marks a significant milestone in my live chat application development journey.
I'm nearing the final stages of backend implementation, with real-time communication features taking shape.
While there are still minor tweaks and optimizations to be made, the core functionality is largely complete. 
This is a huge relief, as I've been working tirelessly to achieve this point.
With the viva date officially announced, the pressure is mounting.
I'm diligently working on the project report and presentation, ensuring that they accurately reflect the challenges I faced and the solutions I implemented.
