I'm drowning in a sea of code. Every line feels like a battle, every bug a relentless enemy.
The once-promising project is now a monstrous task.
It's like staring up at a mountain, knowing the summit is in sight, but feeling like I've climbed for days without end.
Coffee has become my lifeline, and my eyes are starting to resemble those of a zombie.
I'm holding on by a thread, hoping to push through this final stretch. Just a little bit longer. Please.
