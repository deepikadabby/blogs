After a week of intense JavaScript learning, I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed.
Today was particularly challenging as I struggled to grasp a new concept.
It's easy to get discouraged when things don't click immediately, but I know that perseverance is key.
I'll take a break to recharge and come back to the problem with a fresh perspective.
It's important to listen to my body and mind, and sometimes, a short break can make all the difference.
