Today, I continued working on the chat input field for my live chat application.
However, I encountered several frustrating errors that hindered my progress. Debugging these issues proved to be time-consuming and challenging.
I'm struggling to balance my time and energy between these tasks.
Despite the setbacks, I'm determined to persevere and find solutions to these problems.
I'll continue to break down the tasks into smaller, more manageable chunks and seek help from online resources 
and patience and persistence, I believe I can overcome these obstacles and create a robust and user-friendly live chat application.
